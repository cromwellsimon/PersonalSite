# Was having some problems with getting the last version working so looking off of https://dev.to/madhust/how-to-publish-blazor-webassembly-application-to-github-pages-using-github-action-54h4 now.
# I'm assuming that the problem is related to the href rewriting that it's referring to.
# Another difference is that it publishes the changes to a gh-pages branch. This is what I'm used to doing but I wanted to try sourcing it purely from GitHub Actions instead, however it seems to potentially be somewhat problematic?
